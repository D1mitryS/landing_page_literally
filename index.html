                <h3><strong>Step 1:</strong> Take the Seat and Level Off</h3>
                <img src="img/cockpit.jpg" alt="plane cockpit">
                <p>
                    A pilot usually sits in the seat on the left, as there will probably be two
                    seats up front. Sit down, being careful not to touch any controls. There will be plenty of confusing
                    stuff on
                    the dashboard - just ignore it for now. The first thing to do is level off the aircraft.
                    Examine the <i>artificial horizon</i> (Shown in the image below - it's the blue above the brown,
                    with a little pair of wings in the middle). <strong>The blue up top represents the sky, and the
                        brown below represents the ground</strong>.
                    Gently take the <i>yoke</i> (The stick controlling the aircraft), and pull up or down accordingly to
                    make the <i>little wings</i> in the middle, between the blue and the brown.
                    If it seems that this is not working, look outside, and visually level off.
                    <em>Levelling off means that you will fly straight, and not hit the ground or stall and start
                        dropping fast</em>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3><strong>Step 2:</strong>The plane still falling?</h3>
                <img src="img/flying forward.jpg" alt="flying forward plane">
                <p><strong>ONLY FOLLOW THIS STEP IF YOUR SITUATION MATCHES THE FOLLOWING:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    If you've levelled out the plane, but you're falling fast, and you're hearing this strange insistant
                    buzzing or wailing sound, you've <i>stalled</i>. This is very, very bad. It means that the plane is
                    no
                    longer flying, but falling. The thing to do is pitch down and go into a <i>nosedive</i>. As you near
                    the ground, slowly pull up,
                    so you don't crash. If you continue to fall, <strong>then buckle your seat belt</strong>, <em>cause
                        it's gonna get bumpy</em>. Level
                    out as you
                    approach the ground, and try to <i>belly land</i> (Land without the gear down).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3><strong>Step 3:</strong> Okay, It's Level. Now What?</h3>
                <img src="img/descending.jpg" alt="descending plane">
                <p>
                    Okay, so the plane is level. Now you can start <em>yelling</em> for help. There is something called
                    a <i>radio stack</i> in every aircraft, which allows radio communication.
                    Grab the microphone, and look for a button labelled <b>"PTT"</b>, which stands for <i>"Push To
                        Talk"</i>.
                    Grab the pilot's headset as well, and put it on. Push the button, and yell <em>"Mayday!
                        Mayday!"</em> into it. Then, still
                    holding down the button, describe your situation <q>I'm on a 747 bound for Germany, and the pilot's
                        just died!</q>
                    Release the button, and wait for a reply. After 10 seconds, try again. If there is still no
                    responce,
                    <b>change the frequency to 121.5</b> as you would with a normal radio. Then repeat what you did
                    before. 121.5
                    is the emergency frequency. If you get a reply, explain your situation again, and you will recieve
                    help. Follow instructions
                    exactly. If you can't set the frequency, and/or you still hear no reply, look at the bottom screen
                    on the
                    stack. This is the <i>transponder</i>. <b>Set it to 7700. This will alert ATC</b> (Air Traffic
                    Control) to your
                    emergency.

                <h3><strong>Step 4:</strong> Okay, I've Done What They Said, Now What?</h3>
                <img src="img/wheels.jpg" alt="landing gear">
                <p>
                    You've followed their instructions, and now you've got to land. This is the
                    tricky part. The first thing to do is line the plane up with the runway. Make sure you are headed
                    right for it,
                    and flying parallel, so you won't start veering off. Point the nose slightly down, and start to
                    decend.
                    <b>Make sure the wheels are down!</b> ATC should explain which lever does this, as it varies from
                    aircraft to aircraft.

                    <q>
                        There is also the matter of slowing the plane for landing speed, but not so much that it
                        stalls. Slowing is a combination of pointing the nose up slightly while manipulating the
                        throttles to keep
                        speed up, but also not too much extra throttle to keep the plane from climbing. Adjust the
                        throttle so the
                        plane descends about 500 feet per minute. Add a notch or two of flaps so the plane has enough
                        lift at lower
                        speeds without stalling and dropping as if it were a rock.

                    Lining up with the runway can be deceiving. It is easy to aim for the end of the runway and not
                    notice the plane is not really lined up. It is a lot like looking down the length of a board to see
                    if it is
                    straight or warped. Looking at the whole length of the runway at the same time helps to know if the
                    plane is
                    too far right or left of the runway so there are no surprises at the last few seconds. <strong>Aim
                        for the
                        large numbers painted at the end of the runway</strong>.
                    As you approach the runway, gently pull up, so the main wheels touch down first. When you hit the
                    ground, slowly put the nose back down, and apply the brakes (Which usually come one automatically -
                    if not,
                    ask ATC which button to press or lever to pull).

                        Pulling up just before the wheels touch down is a fingertip sensitive operation. If you pull
                        up too much the plane shoots back up into the air. You pull up just enough to hold the plane off
                        of the
                        runway while it settles down gently onto the runway. (When planes bounce back up into the air a
                        few feet on
                        landing, it means the airspeed was too great, yet.) All of this also is based on the infrequent
                        circumstance that there might be no crosswind that will cause the plane to <i>drift</i> off to
                        one side of
                        the runway during the approach. In the event of any <i>crosswind</i> you need to know to use a
                        combination of dipping a wing
                        slightly into the wind to make the plane pull toward the wind while also adding a little
                        <i>rudder</i> in the
                        opposite direction to keep the plane from going too far toward the wind and keeping it headed
                        toward the runway.
