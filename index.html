            <h3 class="card-title"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Take the Seat and Level Off</h3>
            <p2 class="card-paragraph">A pilot usually sits in the seat on the left, as there will probably be two seats
                up
                front. Sit down, being careful not to touch any controls. There will be plenty of confusing stuff on the
                dashboard - just ignore it for now. The first thing to do is level off the aircraft.

                Examine the <i>artificial horizon</i> (Shown in the image below - it's the blue above the brown, with a
                little pair
                of wings in the middle). <strong>The blue up top represents the sky, and the brown below represents the
                    ground</strong>.
                Gently take the <i>yoke</i> (The stick controlling the aircraft), and pull up or down accordingly to
                make the
                <i>little wings</i> in the middle, between the blue and the brown.

                If it seems that this is not working, look outside, and visually level off.

                <em>Levelling off means that you will fly straight, and not hit the ground or stall and start dropping
                    fast</em>.

            <h3 class="card-title"><strong>Step 2:</strong> I've Made the Little Wings Go in the Middle, But the Plane's
                Falling Like a Rock</h3>
            <p2 class="card-paragraph">
                <strong>ONLY FOLLOW THIS STEP IF YOUR SITUATION MATCHES THE FOLLOWING:</strong>

                If you've levelled out the plane, but you're falling fast, and you're hearing this strange insistant
                buzzing
                or wailing sound, you've <i>stalled</i>. This is very, very bad. It means that the plane is no longer
                flying,
                but
                falling.

                The thing to do is pitch down and go into a <i>nosedive</i>. As you near the ground, slowly pull up, so
                you don't
                crash. If you continue to fall, <strong>then buckle your seat belt</strong>, <em>cause it's gonna get
                    bumpy</em>. Level
                out as you
                approach the ground, and try to <i>belly land</i> (Land without the gear down).</p>

            <h3 class="card-title"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Okay, It's Level. Now What?</h3>
            <p2 class="card-paragraph">Okay, so the plane is level. Now you can start <em>yelling</em> for help.

                There is something called a <i>radio stack</i> in every aircraft, which allows radio communication. Grab
                the
                microphone, and look for a button labelled <b>"PTT"</b>, which stands for <i>"Push To Talk"</i>. Grab
                the pilot's headset
                as well, and put it on. Push the button, and yell <em>"Mayday! Mayday!"</em> into it. Then, still
                holding
                down the
                button, describe your situation <q>I'm on a 747 bound for Germany, and the pilot's just died!</q>
                Release
                the button, and wait for a reply. After 10 seconds, try again. If there is still no responce, <b>change
                    the
                    frequency to 121.5</b> as you would with a normal radio. Then repeat what you did before. 121.5 is
                the emergency
                frequency.

                If you get a reply, explain your situation again, and you will recieve help. Follow instructions
                exactly.

                If you can't set the frequency, and/or you still hear no reply, look at the bottom screen on the stack.
                This
                is the <i>transponder</i>. <b>Set it to 7700. This will alert ATC</b> (Air Traffic Control) to your
                emergency.</p>

            <p2 class="card-paragraph">You've followed their instructions, and now you've got to land. This is the
                tricky
                part.

                The first thing to do is line the plane up with the runway. Make sure you are headed right for it, and
                flying parallel, so you won't start veering off. Point the nose slightly down, and start to decend.
                <b>Make
                    sure the wheels are down!</b> ATC should explain which lever does this, as it varies from aircraft
                to aircraft.
                <blockquote>
                    <cite>From Phil B:</cite>
                    <q>There is also the matter of slowing the plane for landing speed, but not so much that it stalls.
                        Slowing is
                        a combination of pointing the nose up slightly while manipulating the throttles to keep speed
                        up, but also
                        not too much extra throttle to keep the plane from climbing. Adjust the throttle so the plane
                        descends about
                        500 feet per minute. Add a notch or two of flaps so the plane has enough lift at lower speeds
                        without
                        stalling and dropping as if it were a rock.</q>
                </blockquote>

                Lining up with the runway can be deceiving. It is easy to aim for the end of the runway and not notice
                the
                plane is not really lined up. It is a lot like looking down the length of a board to see if it is
                straight
                or warped. Looking at the whole length of the runway at the same time helps to know if the plane is too
                far
                right or left of the runway so there are no surprises at the last few seconds. <strong>Aim for the large
                    numbers
                    painted at the end of the runway</strong>.

                As you approach the runway, gently pull up, so the main wheels touch down first. When you hit the
                ground,
                slowly put the nose back down, and apply the brakes (Which usually come one automatically - if not, ask
                ATC
                which button to press or lever to pull).
                <blockquote">
                    <cite>More from Phil:</cite>
                    <q>Pulling up just before the wheels touch down is a fingertip sensitive operation. If you pull up
                        too much
                        the plane shoots back up into the air. You pull up just enough to hold the plane off of the
                        runway while it
                        settles down gently onto the runway. (When planes bounce back up into the air a few feet on
                        landing, it
                        means the airspeed was too great, yet.) All of this also is based on the infrequent circumstance
                        that there
                        might be no <i>crosswind</i> that will cause the plane to <i>drift</i> off to one side of the
                        runway during the approach.
                        In the event of any <i>crosswind</i> you need to know to use a combination of dipping a wing
                        slightly into the wind
                        to make the plane pull toward the wind while also adding a little <i>rudder</i> in the opposite
                        direction to keep
                        the plane from going too far toward the wind and keeping it headed toward the runway.
                    </q>

                    Keep the plane going straight, and slowly come to a stop.</p>
